    <h1>Research Interests</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Additive Manufacturing Security</dt>
        <dd>The additive manufacturing industry is booming, but the proliferation of unchecked digital model files can become a serious security problem.
        <dd>My research is focused on securing the contents of these digital files, and ensuring the additive manufacturing process is secure.  </dd>
        <dd>The research problems I study cover areas of computer science, mathematics, and engineering, including software engineering, algorithm design and analysis, and computational geometry. </dd>

        <dt>Formal Concept Analysis for Bioinformatics</dt>
        <dd>I published a literature survey paper in the ACM Computing Surveys journal on the uses of formal concept analysis, a computational algorithm used to discover patterns in data sets, in bioinformatics. <a style="font-size: 100%" href="papers/fcaPaper.pdf">Link to paper</a></dd>
        <dd>I also published a paper using formal concept analysis to predit types of cancer from gene expression data. <a style="font-size: 100%"  href="papers/gedPaper.pdf">Link to paper</a> </dd>
